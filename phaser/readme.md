# Phaser 3 + Parcel Template
> For people who want to spend time making games instead of configuring build tools.

Then install Parcel:

```bash
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

```

Go into your new project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd phaser3-parcel-template # or 'my-folder-name'
npm install
```

Start development server:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. ðŸŽ‰

## Project Structure

```
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ dist
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ public
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scenes
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HelloWorldScene.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
```

The contents of this template is the basic [Phaser3 getting started example](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part5).

This template assumes you will want to organize your code into multiple files and use modern JavaScript (or TypeScript).

JavaScript files are intended for the `src` folder. `main.js` is the entry point referenced by `index.html`.

Other than that there is no opinion on how you should structure your project. There is a `scenes` folder in `src` where the `HelloWorldScene.js` lives but you can do whatever you want.

## Static Assets

Any static assets like images or audio files should be placed in the `public` folder. It'll then be served at http://localhost:8000/images/my-image.png

Example `public` structure:

```
    public
    â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my-image.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ music
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ sfx
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

They can then be loaded by Phaser with `this.image.load('my-image', 'images/my-image.png')`.

## Dev Server Port

You can change the dev server's port number by modifying the `start` script in `package.json`. We use Parcel's `-p` option to specify the port number.

The script looks like this:

```
parcel src/index.html -p 8000
```

Change 8000 to whatever you want.
